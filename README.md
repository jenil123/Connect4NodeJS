# Connect4NodeJS

Made REST API based connect-4 game simulation
In order to start first run start.js file and go to localhost:3000/start in order to initiallize the game.
Then one after another both the players have to make their moves by going to localhost:3000/column/:id where id represent the column number in which the player wants to enter the dot
After the game is draw or any of the player wins the game ends.
In order for better simulation I would recommend you to simulate the project in POSTMAN
